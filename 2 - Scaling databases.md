As we continue our journey into scaling systems and infrastructure, it’s crucial to examine strategies specifically designed for scaling databases.


In the previous course, [[1 - Scaling systems]], we explored how servers often interact with databases and discussed ways to ensure that servers don’t become a single point of failure in our architecture. But what happens when the database itself becomes the bottleneck? How can we ensure that databases are scalable, resilient, and not a single point of failure in our system?

In this section, we’ll focus on techniques to scale databases effectively and integrate them into a robust, scalable infrastructure.
