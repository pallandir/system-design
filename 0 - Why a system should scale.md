## Case of a small system

Imagine you’re hosting your portfolio website on a simple S3 bucket or through a basic hosting service. Since you don’t anticipate millions or even thousands of visitors daily, your website can comfortably run on a single server, which you can upgrade later if its popularity grows. Now, let’s say an issue arises, and you need to take the website offline for a day to fix it. In this scenario, it wouldn’t be a significant problem for you or your visitors because your business doesn’t depend on constant uptime. This example highlights a use case where minimal resources are sufficient, and scaling or maintaining the infrastructure isn’t a core priority, as the system is designed for low traffic and limited impact.

Now, imagine you’re tasked with designing a system capable of handling millions of transactions per second. In this case, your ability to build a scalable, resilient, and maintainable infrastructure becomes critical, this is a highly sought-after skill in big tech companies. In the next section of this course, we’ll dive into the principles and strategies behind designing robust and scalable solutions.
